# nim01
Java console game based on the game Dr. Nim

Instructions are in the game.
I created this to get back into coding with Java and to check out how Github works because I've only used it to download stuff.

If you want to use this, credit me I guess.
There are some errors like negative numbers being possible to enter which break the game (thank you SpacexerDragon5).
